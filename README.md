# Fake news prediction

## 🚀 Overview
The Fake News Prediction app is a Python-based project designed to classify news articles as either real or fake. This repository contains the code for a simple yet effective machine learning model that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect fake news. The app is built using popular Python libraries such as `pandas`, `nltk`, `sklearn`, and `numpy`.

### Key Features
- **Real-time News Classification**: Classify news articles as real or fake.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple setup and usage instructions.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to different datasets and models.

### Who This Project Is For
- Data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts.
- Journalists and fact-checkers.
- Anyone interested in NLP and fake news detection.

## ✨ Features
- 📊 **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess text data.
- 🔍 **Text Vectorization**: Convert text data into numerical features using TF-IDF.
- 🧠 **Machine Learning Model**: Train a logistic regression model to classify news articles.
- 📈 **Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using accuracy metrics.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Tools**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `nltk` for natural language processing
  - `sklearn` for machine learning
  - `numpy` for numerical operations
